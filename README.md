## Tire_Inc

The Research & Development team of Tire Inc. has been testing a number
of new products for its potential introduction to the market. For each tire, a
number of attributes have been collected expressing the tire characteristics
and the testing condition, as well as the outcome of the test, i.e., success or
failure. As member of the team in charge of data science, you are asked to
predict the failure of a tire and describe which attributes seems to be the
most relevant to predict such outcome.
